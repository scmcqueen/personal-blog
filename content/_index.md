# Welcome to my blog

Hello! It's me. Here is my space where I want to share my thoughts & feelings about a variety of different things. 

## Musings

Thoughts about life, pop culture, and other things.

## Reviews

I watch a lot of movies, read a lot of books, and binge watch Love Island like it's a full time job. I'm obviously going to have opinions.

## Serious Stuff

As I transition from graduate school to working full-time as a data scientist, I want to stay up-to-date on the latest papers and books. This is the spot where I'll keep you updated on my DS readings and (maybe) some cheeky projects!

## Recs

Visiting Ann Arbor? San Mateo? Charlevoix County? Hemet? I got you.
