## Data Scientist, Problem Solver, Crocheter

Hello! I'm Skyeler, a product data scientist at Meta and general data nerd. I did my undergrad at Cornell in theoretical math & german studies (Go Big Red!) and did my masters at University of Michigan (Go Blue!).

I'm passionate about data visualization, trend analysis, and networks.
