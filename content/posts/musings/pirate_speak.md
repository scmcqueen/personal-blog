# Let's bring back pirate speak

### TL;DR: Replace `my` with `me`, `myself` with `meself`, and `hello` with `ahoy`.

Recently, I've been trying to bring back pirate-speak. The whimsical, old-timey, flamboyant way that pirates in movies and tv shows talk (note: this has absolutely 0 basis in any real history or documented literature).

> Ahoy, matey! Shiver me timbers and lead me to some booty.

I think it would be cool. Some people have catch phrases (e.g. calling someone 'boss', saying 'what the helly', etc.) and I think I'm going to make pirate speak mine.

Plus, didn't [Alexander Graham Bell intend for people to say 'Ahoy'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahoy) when answering the phone?

P.S. This has nothing to do with my most recent dreams of taking sailing lessons and swimming from Alcatraz to SF.
